      "description": "Once you’re prepared to take on the task–with or without your dog’s cooperation–here’s what to do:1- Brush your dog before a bath :Matted hair holds water, leaving your dog with irritated skin. If you can’t brush or cut the mats out yourself, take your dog to a professional groomer. You may want to put a cotton ball in each ear to keep water out. It helps prevent ear infections and irritation.  2- Use lukewarm water :Dog skin is different from ours, and hot water can burn dogs more easily. Bath water should never be hotter than what you’d run for a human baby. Keep it even cooler for large-breed dogs who can easily overheat. 3- Talk to your pet in a calm and reassuring voice :Some dogs will eventually learn that you’re not torturing them, although others will continue to hide under the kitchen table whenever you get out a towel. 4- Use dog shampoo :It dries their skin less than people shampoo. Work the shampoo into a gentle lather and massage it all over your dog’s body, being careful not to get soap in their eyes. 5- Rinse well. :Any soap left in their fur can irritate your dog’s skin once they’re dry. Rinse, rinse, and repeat the rinse. 6- Air-dry :Hot air from a human blow-dryer can be too hot for their skin.

      "description": "Although a game of tag may seem like a good idea, and dogs love to chase, they may nip or bite if they get too excited. Consider a game of hide-and-seek instead. The dog is “it” in this game. To begin, have the child hide in fairly easy places. Hold the dog until the child has hidden and then tell him to find her. Occasionally, a child may need to make a noise to help direct the dog, but dogs generally catch on very quickly and have no trouble finding the children. Toys offer interactive fun as well. Many dogs love to retrieve balls, and retrieving is good, safe exercise. Make sure that the ball fits the dog; a Chihuahua can’t manage a tennis ball, and some balls may be a choking hazard for big dogs. The Four Paws® Crunch & Crackle Tug can work as both an interactive toy and one that a dog may play with by himself. Many dogs enjoy tug-of-war, but again, be ready to stop the game if the dog becomes too serious. Teach your child to drop the toy if the game becomes too rough."

      "description": "If the unwanted behavior is jumping on people, remember that any attention, good or bad, is still attention. After a couple of weeks of being completely ignored by you, your dog will figure out that it isn’t getting him what he wants – your attention. To stop bad behaviors like this, it’s important to consider how you respond to the bad behavior. If you yell at your dog when he jumps on people, you are letting him know his bad behavior paid off. Think about what your dog is trying to accomplish when he’s misbehaving and don’t allow him to be rewarded for it. Instead, give him an opportunity to succeed (for example, tell the begging dog to go to his place and lie down, and give him a treat when he does). Behaviors like counter surfing may take longer to stop, and honestly, you may never achieve complete trustworthiness. Because dogs can easily smell that food has been on the counter, they will try for a very long time, just in case a crumb is left up there. If you can make sure that they never, ever find anything good there, then maybe they will give up. This is not easy to do, especially if you have a family. Sooner or later, someone will leave something within reach, and this will give the dog reason to keep checking. Try to make sure your counter is kept as clean as possible – and put your dog in her crate or in the fenced backyard when you are preparing food. Remember that you are communicating with an animal that speaks a different language. To help improve your dog’s behavior, training is key. Try to introduce a new command a week, and practice old ones with him. Besides being able to understand what you want him to do, the mental work involved in him learning commands will tire him out, making him less likely to misbehave."

If you cut the quick (often called quicking), you’ll have an unhappy dog and a bloody mess. The quick bleeds a great deal, so if you cut it, you need either a nail cauterizer — a tool that stops the bleeding by applying heat — or styptic powder you can apply with a cotton swab. Have a damp washcloth at hand ready to clean up styptic powder and blood as necessary. Quicking hurts a lot, and most dogs remember the experience long afterward."

However, eating rotting apples can lead to alcohol poisoning in dogs. 2- White rice :Cooked, plain white rice can be a good option for a dog with an upset stomach, as it is easy to digest and helps bind stool. White rice can cause blood sugar levels to rise, however, so dogs with diabetes should only eat it in small amounts. 3 - Dairy products :Dairy products, such as milk, cheese, and plain yogurt, are safe for dogs to have in very small quantities. Eating too much dairy can cause digestive problems. This is because dogs have low levels of lactase, a digestive enzyme that breaks down the sugars in milk. Dogs with lactose intolerance should not eat dairy products. Signs of lactose intolerances include diarrhea or vomiting after consuming anything that contains dairy. 4- Fish :Salmon, shrimp, and tuna are all safe for dogs to eat and good sources of protein. Salmon and tuna are rich sources of omega-3 fatty acids, which can help keep a dog's immune system, coat, and skin healthy. The B vitamins in shrimp can also help maintain a dog's digestive system and promote healthy blood circulation. It is important to cook fish before feeding it to a dog, as uncooked fish can contain harmful parasites. 5- Chicken :Plain, boiled chicken with no seasoning is a good option when a dog has an upset stomach."

      "description": "On average, dogs spend about 12-to-14 hours of the 24-hour cycle sleeping. Older dogs need significant amounts of sleep simply because, as they age, living becomes more difficult. They tire out more easily and need rest in order to function properly. Puppies, like babies, spend a lot of time exhausting energy while playing and exploring their new surroundings. Because of this, they might need as much as 18-to-20 hours of sleep to recoup! And of course, all dogs need sleep, but it tends to be the bigger breeds that are known for constant dozing. The amount of sleep dogs need also depends on what they are bred to do. For instance, it’s necessary for working dogs to stay awake because of the physical and mental demands they face each day. Dogs that have tasks to hold their attention will spend most of the day active, dedicated to completing those tasks. Dogs that aren’t bred for a certain purpose and lead more sedentary lifestyles, however, will spend most of the day doing whatever they want (i.e. sleeping).",

But you should be cautious if a dog goes still, becomes stiff, and/or is not wagging in a loose and friendly way. Don't corner a dog. All dogs have a sense of personal space, so watch their body language as you get closer (or the dog gets closer to you). When approached by a strange dog, stand quietly, hands at your sides and avoid eye contact. A dog's natural instinct is to chase, so if you run, a dog may chase. Watch the dog out of the corner of your eye and don't turn your back. Do not approach dogs in cars or on chains or ropes. Dogs can be protective about their territory and may feel a bit more vulnerable or defensive than usual. When dogs are tied up, they know they can't run away so their only defense will be to fight. To avoid startling dogs, don't approach or touch them while they're sleeping, fixated on something, or with their puppies. Never get between dogs who are fighting and keep your hands away from their heads. Leave dogs alone when they are eating, whether the dog is eating from a bowl or chewing a treat or any other high-value item. Like people, dogs don't like it when people get between them and their food. Don't reach over or through fences or barriers to pet or touch a dog. ",

Q:What are some signs that I should take my dog to the vet? Dr. McVety:Dogs will generally show some signs that things aren't completely perfect. Most commonly, they will either seek you out more than usual, or hide more than usual. We now have some evidence that their facial expressions change as well. The eyes may be more squinted, tail tucked under, posture lower than normal. These all vary by breed of course, but note a significant deviation from the normal. As a veterinarian, I remind my clients that they know their pet's personality better than anyone. Q:How can I make it easier for my dog to take her pills? Dr. McVety:Giving your dog pills can be very frustrating! The human animal bond might be injured if the owner is frustrated with giving the medication, and the pet is running away. Hiding the pill in peanut butter, pill pouches, wet dog food, or even dissolving it in chicken broth [make sure the broth contains no onion and your vet says the pills are okay to dissolve] are some ideas to help make medication time a little easier.

Do:Let the dog sniff you Introducing yourself to a new dog is all about understanding the dog’s instincts. Dogs have an extremely keen sense of smell. They use scent to understand, and make decisions about, their environment. In just a few sniffs, a dog can get a feel for the gender, health, and even the history of another dog. When a dog sniffs a person, they can determine whether that person has a dog of their own, where in the neighborhood the person might live, and more. They can also pick up on a person’s unique scent to jog their memory as to whether and when they’ve met before! To let a dog sniff you, don’t extend your hand to their face. Instead, let the dog approach you and sniff your hand on their own terms. Don’t:Pet him on the head When first meeting a dog, always take care to respect their boundaries. Petting on the head can be threatening for a dog, especially when the person petting them is a complete stranger.",

Gloves and Protective Clothing Washing your cat can be a contact sport, so you should prepare yourself with the right equipment. Thick, vinyl dishwashing gloves (you know, the yellow ones) will protect your hands and forearms. Long sleeves are a good idea, too. Basically, expose as little skin as possible just in case kitty reaches out to scratch. Pet parents also have been known to wear goggles due to excessive splashing. 3.Towels You'll need one washcloth for your cat's face and head, a second for her body and one big bath towel to wrap her up in afterward. Have extra towels on hand for the unexpected. Gray and white kitten being washed in a kitten sink. 4. Shampoo You'll find a wide range of cat shampoos at your local retailer or online. Read ingredient labels carefully, and, as VetStreet advises, do not buy shampoo meant for dogs or humans as it may irritate your kitty's coat and skin. Some cat shampoos don't require water but ask your veterinarian first to be sure this type of cleanser is appropriate for your cat, and that she doesn't have any allergies to any of the included ingredients."

      "description": "How your cat interacts with you and other people depends on his disposition, past experiences, and the current circumstances. Shy cats will adapt to unfamiliar people and environments with greater difficulty and are more likely to react fearfully in new situations. Kittens go through a critical learning phase between the ages of 2 to 7 weeks, called the sensitive period of socialization. During this time, kittens learn to accept contact with other species, such as dogs and humans, as well as unrelated cats. By the time you adopt a kitten and bring it home, this period is usually finished. Kittens who have not received regular friendly handling by humans during 2-7 weeks of age may remain uneasy with human contact all their lives. How to Approach a Cat When approaching your cat, it is best to let him make the first move and approach you. Imagine yourself faced with a 50-foot-tall giant and then you can start to understand a cat’s perspective. There are small things you can do to appear less intimidating:Avoid loud noises and abrupt movements that might startle your cat. Refrain from looming over him, since it makes you appear larger and potentially threatening. Instead sit down on the floor to put yourself at his level. Try inviting your cat into your space instead of moving into his space. Avoid chasing after your cat because this can cause him to become fearful, an experience that can negatively color future interactions with you. Approaching an unfamiliar cat is always a potentially risky proposition since he is not familiar to you. Although the unknown cat might act friendly, a sudden noise or movement could trigger an aggressive response towards you. When visiting someone’s home, it’s always good to inquire about their cat’s behavior towards strangers. If this cat is friendly towards strangers, put your fingers out for this cat to smell and approach you before attempting to pet him. "

You will know if your cat’s nails have grown too long if your cat gets their nails stuck in carpets or other soft surfaces, or if your cat can no longer retract her nails. Severely overgrown and curved nails can grow into the footpad, causing significant pain and mobility problems. Therefore, it is very important to keep your cat’s nails short. Cat should have their nails trimmed every 10 days to 2 weeks so that they do not get to this point. Keeping Your Cat Calm Unfortunately, trimming cat nails can be challenging, because most cats do not like nail trims. Here are some helpful tips on the cat nail trimming process and how to keep a cat calm during a nail trim. Select a comfortable chair in a quiet room where your cat can’t look out the window. Hold your cat in your lap when she’s relaxed and a little sleepy, such as after a meal. For at least several days before the nail trim, massage your cat’s front legs and paws, pressing gently on each foot pad with your thumb and forefinger to extend the corresponding nail. Release the pressure and immediately give your cat a cat treat. Acclimate your cat to the sound of nail clippers. Place a piece of uncooked spaghetti in the cat nail clippers. When you press on a foot pad as described above, ‘clip’ the spaghetti when the nail extends. Release the pressure and immediately treat your cat. How to Clip Cat Nails When your cat is calm and is comfortable with you touching her paws, you can now trim her nails. Several types of cat nail clippers are available. Scissor-type clippers, such as the JW Pet Gripsoft Cat Nail Clipper and Four Paws Ulitmate Touch Cat Caw Clipper, work great for clipping cat nails. Guillotine clippers, such as the Hertzko Professional Dog & Cat Nail Clipper & Nail File, also work well."

The younger children may have a harder time grasping how to properly handle and play with your cat. Younger children are more likely to unintentionally play rough and take their frustrations out on pets. If your children are too young to understand spoken instructions on “playing nice” then your best bet is to lead by example. ,Important Things to Teach Your Child ,Respect ,Teaching your child to respect all creatures is a gift for both child and your cat. ,You know when your cat is scared or overwhelmed. ,Let your child know your cat wishes to be left alone, not touched when sleeping, and to respect the kitty’s feelings. ,Play ,Modeling the behavior will show your child how to “play nice.” ,Have your child watch you play and speak gently to your cat. Then have them do it as you supervise. ,Safety ,Showing your child how to handle the family cat will keep them both safe. ,Explain that cats do not feel secure when “big people” suddenly pick them up. ,If age appropriate, show them the proper way to pick up and hold your cat with their arm under the cat’s bottom. Explain that this should only be done when you are there to supervise. ,Care ,Letting your child help care for your cat by giving her/him age appropriate tasks will allow the two to form a bond. ,Even a very young child can help with feeding when supervised. Make sure to let your child know what you are doing and why it is important."

      "description": "While you are caring for a pregnant cat, do not give her any vaccines, and consult with your vet for proper treatment of parasites like fleas and worms. Feed the mama-cat-to-be a high-quality food that is labeled for growth/kittens, approved by The Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO), and properly supplemented with taurine, Dr. Guess advises. Taurine deficiencies can cause fetal deformities or even death. It may be helpful to supplement with canned food to ensure the pregnant cat is getting enough calories, especially during the latter part of gestation. You need to create a “queening” box, where your cat will make her nest and give birth. Find a warm place with a lot of privacy to put the queening box. You can use a cardboard box, laundry basket or other roomy container, and line it with things like blankets, sheets, newspapers and puppy pads. “Use something you’re ready to throw away after you have kittens, because it’s going to be bloody and it’s going to be messy,” says Dr. Foote, owner of Okaw Veterinary Clinic in Tuscola, Illinois. Ideally, Dr. Guess advises, a queening box should have raised sides, a side entrance that is off the ground and a removable lid. But cats being cats, your queen might not cooperate with your choice of birthing quarters. “Of course, some will decide the box is not ideal and will think someplace like the middle of the owner’s bed is a good place to give birth,” Dr. Guess says."

      "description": "Safety Tips for Kids and Cats According to The American Pet Products Association 62 percent of American households have either a dog, a cat, or both. Chances are, if you already have pets and kids, they’ve learned how to get along. But if you’re thinking of adopting a new cat, then it’s worth an overview of kid and cat safety tips. After all, cats have sharp claws and kids aren’t always gentle with cats. Yet, there’s an easy way around that, and it’s to teach your children how respect cats as living creatures and learn how to interact with them in a positive way. As you know, it’s not difficult to recognize kitty behavior and know when to give them some space. It's important to know the signs. The beauty is, your kids have lots of control over this since they can learn how to approach the cat and when to leave it alone. Children Have a Wonderful Opportunity When it Comes to Cats When children are gentle and kind, friendly cats will come to trust and appreciate them. But if the children are loud and unpredictable, then the cat is going to make itself scarce. The opportunity then is for the child to learn how to approach a cat in a friendly manner, which may mean not approaching the cat at all, but allowing the cat to come to them instead As Hillspet reminds us, “As adorable as she may be, she's a living companion who has just as many feelings as her human housemates. And although cats can become frightened of kids if they are too rough, playing gently on her terms will make her more likely to enjoy their company.",

Seeing your beloved cat suffering is upsetting, so here are a few important things to keep in mind while caring for your sick cat so they may be back to normal in no time. It is best to take your pet to the vet as soon as possible, so that you can pin point exactly what is causing their ailment. The points given below are only to aid the recovery of your feline friend after a trip to the vet. Do’s :Offer fresh clean water:It is important that cats stay hydrated when they are sick. Much like humans, dehydration or drinking unclean water can only make their condition worse. So remember to offer your pet cats clean drinkable water in a clean bowl regularly. Feed your sick cat healthy food:Consuming nutritious food can speed up their recovery. Getting a sick cat to eat can be quite the challenge, but offering slightly-warmed canned food like tuna or chicken with their natural juices and oil may help. You may need to hand feed them at first if they are not eating on their own. Clean nose, eyes and ears regularly:Make sure you wipe away any kind of discharge from their eyes, nose or ears with warm salt water. This may help to avoid any kind of infection and irritation. Keeping your cat clean will definitely help them get well soon. Keep them warm and comfortable:A warm and cosy space helps your cat to rest and relax while they recuperate.",
