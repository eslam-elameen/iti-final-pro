      "description": "Once you’re prepared to take on the task–with or without your dog’s cooperation–here’s what to do:1- Brush your dog before a bath :Matted hair holds water, leaving your dog with irritated skin. If you can’t brush or cut the mats out yourself, take your dog to a professional groomer. You may want to put a cotton ball in each ear to keep water out. It helps prevent ear infections and irritation.  2- Use lukewarm water :Dog skin is different from ours, and hot water can burn dogs more easily. Bath water should never be hotter than what you’d run for a human baby. Keep it even cooler for large-breed dogs who can easily overheat. 3- Talk to your pet in a calm and reassuring voice :Some dogs will eventually learn that you’re not torturing them, although others will continue to hide under the kitchen table whenever you get out a towel. 4- Use dog shampoo :It dries their skin less than people shampoo. Work the shampoo into a gentle lather and massage it all over your dog’s body, being careful not to get soap in their eyes. 5- Rinse well. :Any soap left in their fur can irritate your dog’s skin once they’re dry. Rinse, rinse, and repeat the rinse. 6- Air-dry :Hot air from a human blow-dryer can be too hot for their skin. Either air-dry or use a blow-dryer designed for dogs; its lower temperatures won’t cause itching or dandruff. 7- Reward your dog :Follow up with abundant praise, petting, or play. Many a damp dog loves to vent their frustration over bath time by playing exuberant tug-of-war with the bath towel–or just running away with it–when it’s all over."

      "descrtion": "Although a game of tag may seem like a good idea, and dogs love to chase, they may nip or bite if they get too excited. Consider a game of hide-and-seek instead. The dog is “it” in this game. To begin, have the child hide in fairly easy places. Hold the dog until the child has hidden and then tell him to find her. Occasionally, a child may need to make a noise to help direct the dog, but dogs generally catch on very quickly and have no trouble finding the children. Toys offer interactive fun as well. Many dogs love to retrieve balls, and retrieving is good, safe exercise. Make sure that the ball fits the dog; a Chihuahua can’t manage a tennis ball, and some balls may be a choking hazard for big dogs. The Four Paws® Crunch & Crackle Tug can work as both an interactive toy and one that a dog may play with by himself. Many dogs enjoy tug-of-war, but again, be ready to stop the game if the dog becomes too serious. Teach your child to drop the toy if the game becomes too rough."

      "img": "http://cdn.akc.org/content/article-body-image/dog_looking_for_food.jpg",
      "description": "If the unwanted behavior is jumping on people, remember that any attention, good or bad, is still attention. After a couple of weeks of being completely ignored by you, your dog will figure out that it isn’t getting him what he wants – your attention. To stop bad behaviors like this, it’s important to consider how you respond to the bad behavior. If you yell at your dog when he jumps on people, you are letting him know his bad behavior paid off. Think about what your dog is trying to accomplish when he’s misbehaving and don’t allow him to be rewarded for it. Instead, give him an opportunity to succeed (for example, tell the begging dog to go to his place and lie down, and give him a treat when he does). Behaviors like counter surfing may take longer to stop, and honestly, you may never achieve complete trustworthiness. Because dogs can easily smell that food has been on the counter, they will try for a very long time, just in case a crumb is left up there. If you can make sure that they never, ever find anything good there, then maybe they will give up. This is not easy to do, especially if you have a family. Sooner or later, someone will leave something within reach, and this will give the dog reason to keep checking. Try to make sure your counter is kept as clean as possible – and put your dog in her crate or in the fenced backyard when you are preparing food. Remember that you are communicating with an animal that speaks a different language. To help improve your dog’s behavior, training is key. Try to introduce a new command a week, and practice old ones with him. Besides being able to understand what you want him to do, the mental work involved in him learning commands will tire him out, making him less likely to misbehave."

      "description": "1- Hold the foot steady, but hold it gently. 2- Snip off a small bit of the end of each toenail. Using either the guillotine or scissors-type clippers, place a tiny bit of the nail in the nail clipper and snip. If the nail feels spongy while you’re trying to cut it, stop immediately — you’re cutting the quick! 3- Stop any bleeding immediately. If you cut the quick (often called quicking), you’ll have an unhappy dog and a bloody mess. The quick bleeds a great deal, so if you cut it, you need either a nail cauterizer — a tool that stops the bleeding by applying heat — or styptic powder you can apply with a cotton swab. Have a damp washcloth at hand ready to clean up styptic powder and blood as necessary. Quicking hurts a lot, and most dogs remember the experience long afterward."

      "description": " 1- Apples :'Apples provide many important vitamins for dogs, including vitamins A and C. Apples are also a good source of fiber, which can help regulate a dog's digestion. However, eating rotting apples can lead to alcohol poisoning in dogs. 2- White rice :Cooked, plain white rice can be a good option for a dog with an upset stomach, as it is easy to digest and helps bind stool. White rice can cause blood sugar levels to rise, however, so dogs with diabetes should only eat it in small amounts. 3 - Dairy products :Dairy products, such as milk, cheese, and plain yogurt, are safe for dogs to have in very small quantities. Eating too much dairy can cause digestive problems. This is because dogs have low levels of lactase, a digestive enzyme that breaks down the sugars in milk. Dogs with lactose intolerance should not eat dairy products. Signs of lactose intolerances include diarrhea or vomiting after consuming anything that contains dairy. 4- Fish :Salmon, shrimp, and tuna are all safe for dogs to eat and good sources of protein. Salmon and tuna are rich sources of omega-3 fatty acids, which can help keep a dog's immune system, coat, and skin healthy. The B vitamins in shrimp can also help maintain a dog's digestive system and promote healthy blood circulation. It is important to cook fish before feeding it to a dog, as uncooked fish can contain harmful parasites. 5- Chicken :Plain, boiled chicken with no seasoning is a good option when a dog has an upset stomach."

      "title": "Why Do Dogs Sleep So Much?",
      "description": "On average, dogs spend about 12-to-14 hours of the 24-hour cycle sleeping. Older dogs need significant amounts of sleep simply because, as they age, living becomes more difficult. They tire out more easily and need rest in order to function properly. Puppies, like babies, spend a lot of time exhausting energy while playing and exploring their new surroundings. Because of this, they might need as much as 18-to-20 hours of sleep to recoup! And of course, all dogs need sleep, but it tends to be the bigger breeds that are known for constant dozing. The amount of sleep dogs need also depends on what they are bred to do. For instance, it’s necessary for working dogs to stay awake because of the physical and mental demands they face each day. Dogs that have tasks to hold their attention will spend most of the day active, dedicated to completing those tasks. Dogs that aren’t bred for a certain purpose and lead more sedentary lifestyles, however, will spend most of the day doing whatever they want (i.e. sleeping).",

They provide love and laughter, comedy and comfort, and they share our homes and our lives. We wouldn't have it any other way! But they are also so much more, to so many people. Dogs are truly amazing creatures. Here are some of the many ways dogs help people. Service Dogs There are many types of service dogs. Here are a few of the more common:Hearing dogs are trained to alert their handlers to household sounds such as doorbells or knocks, a ringing phone, smoke detector alarms, oven timers, crying babies, etc. Hearing dogs are used with both deaf and hearing-impaired people. Guide dogs ('seeing eye dogs' help people who are blind or visually impaired. They are trained to help navigate around obstacles, under the direction of the person they are paired with. Guide dogs help people have more confidence in going about their day-to-day activities. Mobility dogs help with physical tasks. They do things like stabilize someone while they're walking, turn lights on or off, pick up dropped items, opening and closing doors, etc. Medical alert/response dogs have the ability to sense seizures before they actually occur. It's not known how they can sense this - but speculation is that these dogs can either sense a change in our body chemistry or in tiny muscle movements that humans cannot detect. Medical alert/response dogs provide people with advance notice that something is about to happen, giving the person time to take medication, move somewhere safe, or call for help. Dogs can also perform tasks like blocking people from stairways or helping them to rise to their feet, among many other tasks..",

      "description": "Safety around dogsAlways ask permission before petting or touching someone else's dog. Most of the time, we encounter friendly, wiggly dogs in public. But you should be cautious if a dog goes still, becomes stiff, and/or is not wagging in a loose and friendly way. Don't corner a dog. All dogs have a sense of personal space, so watch their body language as you get closer (or the dog gets closer to you). When approached by a strange dog, stand quietly, hands at your sides and avoid eye contact. A dog's natural instinct is to chase, so if you run, a dog may chase. Watch the dog out of the corner of your eye and don't turn your back. Do not approach dogs in cars or on chains or ropes. Dogs can be protective about their territory and may feel a bit more vulnerable or defensive than usual. When dogs are tied up, they know they can't run away so their only defense will be to fight. To avoid startling dogs, don't approach or touch them while they're sleeping, fixated on something, or with their puppies. Never get between dogs who are fighting and keep your hands away from their heads. Leave dogs alone when they are eating, whether the dog is eating from a bowl or chewing a treat or any other high-value item. Like people, dogs don't like it when people get between them and their food. Don't reach over or through fences or barriers to pet or touch a dog. Never tease, chase or harass a dog. Don't enter a property containing a dog if you're not accompanied by the dog's person. Dogs can be protective of their family and territory and think it's their job to protect them. The dog-safe family  Children should always be accompanied around dogs, even the family dog. Supervising children around dogs not only protects the children from accidents but also protects the dog from harm by children who don't always know that touching animals in a certain way can hurt them. Don't leave babies unattended around dogs. Dogs may not realize that babies aren't as strong as adults or even know what a baby is. If you're expecting a baby, start early to get your dog used to the changes a baby will make in your dog's and your lives. Don't attempt or allow your children to attempt to remove anything (toys, food or other objects) from your dog's mouth. Instead, find something of equal or greater value to offer your dog as a trade. Teach your children about dog safety early and promote dog-safe practices. If you are considering bringing a new dog into your family, write down what your family is like and then consult your local shelter staff or do research on the Internet to learn about what kind of dog would be best for you.

      "title": "How to Care for a Sick Dog ?",
      "description": "When your dog is sick, you want to comfort her in every way possible. But how do you know that you're doing all the right things? We talked to Dr. Dani McVety, a veterinarian and co-founder of the veterinary hospice Lap of Love, to find out exactly what pet parents can do to help their sick dogs feel better. Q:What are some signs that I should take my dog to the vet? Dr. McVety:Dogs will generally show some signs that things aren't completely perfect. Most commonly, they will either seek you out more than usual, or hide more than usual. We now have some evidence that their facial expressions change as well. The eyes may be more squinted, tail tucked under, posture lower than normal. These all vary by breed of course, but note a significant deviation from the normal. As a veterinarian, I remind my clients that they know their pet's personality better than anyone. Q:How can I make it easier for my dog to take her pills? Dr. McVety:Giving your dog pills can be very frustrating! The human animal bond might be injured if the owner is frustrated with giving the medication, and the pet is running away. Hiding the pill in peanut butter, pill pouches, wet dog food, or even dissolving it in chicken broth [make sure the broth contains no onion and your vet says the pills are okay to dissolve] are some ideas to help make medication time a little easier. If you find the right combination, it could actually be a positive experience. Q:Are certain foods or treats extra comforting to a sick dog? Dr. McVety:This certainly depends on the type of disease the pet has. Low-sodium chicken broth is necessary for any kind of kidney issues, and there are some subconscious caring feelings that occur when we give our own dog chicken noodle soup! Otherwise, single protein and simple carbohydrate meals will be the gentlest on a pet's stomach. For example, chicken and plain rice.",

      "title": "Meeting a Dog For the First Time?",
      "description": "Do:Let the dog approach you When meeting a dog, it’s important to be calm and go slow. Your first instinct may be to run towards the dog with open arms, but not so fast! Approaching a dog in this way may startle them, and it can come off as intimidating. Instead, hold a natural stance, and allow the dog to come to you. You want to avoid coming across as fearful, however, as this can lead the dog to be defensive. Be careful, yet confident, when meeting a dog for the first time. Do:Let the dog sniff you Introducing yourself to a new dog is all about understanding the dog’s instincts. Dogs have an extremely keen sense of smell. They use scent to understand, and make decisions about, their environment. In just a few sniffs, a dog can get a feel for the gender, health, and even the history of another dog. When a dog sniffs a person, they can determine whether that person has a dog of their own, where in the neighborhood the person might live, and more. They can also pick up on a person’s unique scent to jog their memory as to whether and when they’ve met before! To let a dog sniff you, don’t extend your hand to their face. Instead, let the dog approach you and sniff your hand on their own terms. Don’t:Pet him on the head When first meeting a dog, always take care to respect their boundaries. Petting on the head can be threatening for a dog, especially when the person petting them is a complete stranger. Rather than reach for his head right away, start by petting them gently on their back or shoulders. Then, you can work your way towards their face if they are comfortable with it. Do:Pay attention to body language Just like humans, dogs communicate through body language. When it comes to decoding dog body language, we have a few tips. In general, things like a curved body, wagging tail, and excitedly circling around you is a good sign; it means they want to get to know you. Bowing down with front legs extended is a gesture that says “Play with me!”. Watch out for anything that could indicate an aggressive or threatening mood, like showing teeth or a stiff, erect tail. It’s also important to note that all dogs react differently to stress. Some may express discomfort or anxiety by licking their lips or yawning. This is considered normal behavior for a dog who is put in a stressful or unfamiliar situation. Do:Use a calm, low voice when meeting a dog It’s common for people to use “baby talk” when first meeting a dog but the correct way to approach a dog is to speak in your normal voice. Keep it calm and low. Using a higher pitched voice can signal weakness as well as stress out the dog. Establish your relationship right from the start by emanating confidence and respect for any new dog you meet.",

      "description": "1. Cat Handler Although you may not think of another person as part of your must-have list, don't underestimate the power of an assistant. VCA Animal Hospitals points out that sometimes two hands isn't enough when dealing with four paws, so it's recommended that you enlist a trusted friend or family member to help out. For obvious reasons, a fellow cat lover who understands how to properly handle a cat is best. 2. Gloves and Protective Clothing Washing your cat can be a contact sport, so you should prepare yourself with the right equipment. Thick, vinyl dishwashing gloves (you know, the yellow ones) will protect your hands and forearms. Long sleeves are a good idea, too. Basically, expose as little skin as possible just in case kitty reaches out to scratch. Pet parents also have been known to wear goggles due to excessive splashing. 3.Towels You'll need one washcloth for your cat's face and head, a second for her body and one big bath towel to wrap her up in afterward. Have extra towels on hand for the unexpected. Gray and white kitten being washed in a kitten sink. 4. Shampoo You'll find a wide range of cat shampoos at your local retailer or online. Read ingredient labels carefully, and, as VetStreet advises, do not buy shampoo meant for dogs or humans as it may irritate your kitty's coat and skin. Some cat shampoos don't require water but ask your veterinarian first to be sure this type of cleanser is appropriate for your cat, and that she doesn't have any allergies to any of the included ingredients. 5. Treats Unless she's a rare exception, your cat will not be very happy with you after bath time. It may be a good idea to have some of her favorite kibble on hand to reward her for getting through the experience."

      "title": "How to Pet & Handle Cats",
      "img": "https://catfriendly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Best-Ways-to-Handle-Cats.png",
      "description": "Behavior Basicscanstockphoto11663661 How your cat interacts with you and other people depends on his disposition, past experiences, and the current circumstances. Shy cats will adapt to unfamiliar people and environments with greater difficulty and are more likely to react fearfully in new situations. Kittens go through a critical learning phase between the ages of 2 to 7 weeks, called the sensitive period of socialization. During this time, kittens learn to accept contact with other species, such as dogs and humans, as well as unrelated cats. By the time you adopt a kitten and bring it home, this period is usually finished. Kittens who have not received regular friendly handling by humans during 2-7 weeks of age may remain uneasy with human contact all their lives. How to Approach a Cat When approaching your cat, it is best to let him make the first move and approach you. Imagine yourself faced with a 50-foot-tall giant and then you can start to understand a cat’s perspective. There are small things you can do to appear less intimidating:Avoid loud noises and abrupt movements that might startle your cat. Refrain from looming over him, since it makes you appear larger and potentially threatening. Instead sit down on the floor to put yourself at his level. Try inviting your cat into your space instead of moving into his space. Avoid chasing after your cat because this can cause him to become fearful, an experience that can negatively color future interactions with you. Approaching an unfamiliar cat is always a potentially risky proposition since he is not familiar to you. Although the unknown cat might act friendly, a sudden noise or movement could trigger an aggressive response towards you. When visiting someone’s home, it’s always good to inquire about their cat’s behavior towards strangers. If this cat is friendly towards strangers, put your fingers out for this cat to smell and approach you before attempting to pet him. Do not approach an outdoor cat if you are not familiar with him. This will protect you from potential bites, scratches, and infectious diseases such as rabies and cat scratch disease. If this unknown cat is allowed outdoors, there’s the added risk of transmission of infectious diseases to consider before having physical contact. Rabies is a deadly viral disease that can be transmitted through a bite. Upper respiratory viruses and feline distemper (feline panleukopenia virus) are not contagious to people, but can be carried on hands and clothes to potentially vulnerable cats at home. Fleas and flea eggs can also hitch a ride on someone’s clothes or shoes. Picking Up Cats When you pick up your cat, he experiences a sudden loss of control and his entire sense of security is altered. Some cats – especially if fearful in a new environment or more anxious cats – should not be picked up if at all possible to avoid further stress to him and potential injury to you. Signs that your cat is stressed include:a tense body, dilated pupils, ears back, and hissing or crying out. When you want or need to pick up your cat, you should always do your best to provide him with a sense of security while you’re handling him. If your cat is feeling anxious or stressed, then he might struggle, potentially harming himself or you. Different cats have varying levels of tolerance to being held by people. Unless necessary, try to limit handling to your cat’s tolerance level. Instead of picking him up, entice your cat with treats or toys to get him where you want or need him to be. If it is necessary to pick up your cat to put into a carrier or to remove from danger, have the carrier close by and calmly move towards your cat from behind or the side because coming from the front is often threatening. Carrier training prevents or greatly reduces the need to pick up your cat to put him into the carrier. As a general rule, you should use both hands to pick up your cat. One hand should scoop up his behind while the other hand supports his front chest. Limit the amount of time your cat is dangling mid-air and provide your cat with as much body contact as possible to hold him securely. Avoid holding your cat in a death grip since this will cause anxiety. Lifting your cat by the scruff is never recommended. Females only carry kittens by their scruff in the first few weeks of life. Although some cats don’t mind being scruffed, many find it stressful even if they do not struggle.Heavier cats might even find being lifted by the scruff painful. The better you know your cat, the better you will be able to read his subtle body language and predict the right time to set him down again. Your cat may respond negatively to odors, such as menthol or strong perfumes and will attempt to get away from these odors. Petting Catsistock_000001214306medium-copy-2 Despite evolving as solitary hunters, cats are very social and will form colonies, or social groups, when resources (food, water, shelter) are abundant. Within a colony, cats rub against one another and groom each other to strengthen their bonds and to maintain a group odor for easier recognition. You engage in this behavior when you pet your cat. When your cat rubs against you, this can sometimes be misinterpreted as a request for food. In some cases, overconsumption of food and weight gain may result from this miscommunication. Most cats prefer to be touched on the head and neck. Your cat may become upset and even aggressive when people attempt to pet him in other areas. Certain cats will become aroused when you pet them for extended periods of time. They will often nip or catch your hand with their claws in warning when they have reached their limit. The best remedy is to avoid reaching that tipping point by reading the subtle cues in your cat’s body language. Your cat will go very still with only the tip of the tail twitching. His ears might be slightly lowered and to the sides and sometimes his back will ripple a bit. If your cat is on someone’s lap and he is already upset, rather than attempting to pick up your cat it is best to simply get up and walk away."

      "img": "https://petlifetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Vet-trimming-a-dogs-nails.jpg",
      "description": "Why It’s Important to Trim Cat Nails Regularly Overgrown nails become curved and don’t retract completely. You will know if your cat’s nails have grown too long if your cat gets their nails stuck in carpets or other soft surfaces, or if your cat can no longer retract her nails. Severely overgrown and curved nails can grow into the footpad, causing significant pain and mobility problems. Therefore, it is very important to keep your cat’s nails short. Cat should have their nails trimmed every 10 days to 2 weeks so that they do not get to this point. Keeping Your Cat Calm Unfortunately, trimming cat nails can be challenging, because most cats do not like nail trims. Here are some helpful tips on the cat nail trimming process and how to keep a cat calm during a nail trim. Select a comfortable chair in a quiet room where your cat can’t look out the window. Hold your cat in your lap when she’s relaxed and a little sleepy, such as after a meal. For at least several days before the nail trim, massage your cat’s front legs and paws, pressing gently on each foot pad with your thumb and forefinger to extend the corresponding nail. Release the pressure and immediately give your cat a cat treat. Acclimate your cat to the sound of nail clippers. Place a piece of uncooked spaghetti in the cat nail clippers. When you press on a foot pad as described above, ‘clip’ the spaghetti when the nail extends. Release the pressure and immediately treat your cat. How to Clip Cat Nails When your cat is calm and is comfortable with you touching her paws, you can now trim her nails. Several types of cat nail clippers are available. Scissor-type clippers, such as the JW Pet Gripsoft Cat Nail Clipper and Four Paws Ulitmate Touch Cat Caw Clipper, work great for clipping cat nails. Guillotine clippers, such as the Hertzko Professional Dog & Cat Nail Clipper & Nail File, also work well. If you’re not sure which nail clipper to choose, your veterinarian can help you decide which clipper type would be best for you and your cat. Below are the steps to properly trim cat nails:Organize your supplies:sharp cat nail clippers, a towel and styptic powder (if a nail starts to bleed). Place your cat in your lap with her facing away from you and your forearm over her neck. Gently wrap her in the towel if she starts to squirm. Massage and press a foot pad to extend the nail. Locate the quick, which is the pink portion of the nail that contains nerves and blood vessels. Before clipping, position the clippers perpendicular to the nail so you are cutting it from top to bottom; cutting side to side may split the nail. Cut only the sharp tip of the nail. Do NOT cut the quick! Cutting the quick will be painful and cause bleeding. If you accidentally cut the quick, apply a small amount of styptic powder to quickly stop the bleeding. Depending on your cat’s temperament, you may be able to cut only a few nails at a time, and that’s okay. Be patient with your cat and don’t punish her if she resists the nail trim. If your cat continually refuses your attempts to trim her nails, take her to your veterinarian or groomer for a nail trim."

      "description": " 1- Apples :Meat & Eggs ,Cats are carnivores, so their diets must be largely made up of protein. A major misconception about human food for cats is that felines should be consuming raw meat. It’s true that some pet parents put their cats on a raw food diet, but this requires extremely cautious preparation work. Raw meat containing E. coli, salmonella, or listeria will sicken a cat, just as it will humans. So, only serve your kitty plain (seasoning such as garlic or onion powder could be toxic) and cooked meat—and talk to your veterinarian before putting your cat on a raw food diet. ,Serve sparingly:,Cooked salmon (omega-3 fatty acids help with vision, arthritis, kidney disease, and heart disorders) ,Canned fish ,Skinless chicken ,Turkey ,Lean beef ,Lean deli meats ,Lamb ,Cooked eggs ,Actively avoid:,Sushi/raw fish ,Raw meat ,Fat trimmings ,Raw or cooked bones ,Raw eggs ,Vegetables ,Some veggies contain the added nutrients, fiber, and water that any cat could use, particularly for digestive issues. Cook or steam broccoli, asparagus, carrots, and green beans for easier consumption. Do not allow your cat anything from the allium family (including spices and powders), such as garlic or onions—these can cause damage to your cat’s red blood cells, leading to anemia or even death. ,Serve sparingly:,Peas ,Broccoli ,Asparagus ,Carrots ,Green beans ,Spinach (avoid if your cat has had any urinary or kidney problems) ,Actively avoid:,Onions ,Garlic ,Shallots ,Chives ,Scallions ,Green tomatoes ,Mushrooms ,Fruit ,Cats can’t taste sweet flavors. Yet there’s always the occasional oddball that enjoys a piece of fruit, which can also aid with digestive issues. For a creamy treat, blend the fruit with a tiny bit of plain, low-fat yogurt. ,Serve sparingly:,Bananas ,Peeled apples (no seeds) ,Blueberries ,Cucumber ,Cantaloupe/watermelon (no seeds) ,Pumpkin/squash (no seeds) ,Avocado (no pit) ,Actively avoid:,Grapes and raisins (even a small amount can cause kidney failure in cats) ,Grains ,Many cats enjoy grains with a smaller texture, like couscous and millet. Make sure you don’t feed your cat raw dough of any kind, as it causes expansion or creates alcohol in the stomach. Finally, not all seeds or nuts are harmful to cats, but many are—and those that aren’t are likely high in salt and fat. It’s best just to avoid these altogether. ,Serve sparingly:,Cooked corn/polenta ,Couscous/millet ,Bread/breadcrumbs ,Oats/oatmeal (high in protein) ,Mashed brown rice, barley, or wheat berries ,Actively avoid:,Raw dough ,Seeds and nuts ,Dairy ,Many people are either under the misconception that cats should have lots of dairy (think little saucers of milk), or have heard that cats are actually wildly lactose-intolerant. The truth lies somewhere in the middle:Every cat is different, but most can tolerate a small amount of low-lactose dairy. ,Serve sparingly:,Hard cheeses (like cheddar, swiss, or gouda) ,Low-lactose cheeses (cottage cheese) ,Yogurt (plain, unsweetened, low-fat) ,Actively avoid:,Cow’s milk ,Soft cheeses ,Anything high-lactose ,Other human foods that may be harmful to cats ,Chocolate (find out why cats and chocolate don’t mix) ,Caffeine ,Alcohol ,Plant-based milk (high in fats and oils) ,Sugar and spices in general ,Candy and gum ,Ice cream (contains propylene glycol) ,Anything marijuana/THC-infused ,Human medications/supplements (the exception might be fish oil, in small doses) ,When it comes to human food for cats, err on the side of caution. Even if the food you serve your kitty isn’t known to be harmful, she could still have a small bout of upset stomach, diarrhea, or vomiting. If that happens, she may be a little more sensitive to human food than the average cat. Practice prudence in any case!."

      "description": "A family cat can bring endless joy to your household, but it is important to teach children of all ages how to appropriately interact with their furry friend. ,With older children, you can have a simple conversation. The younger children may have a harder time grasping how to properly handle and play with your cat. Younger children are more likely to unintentionally play rough and take their frustrations out on pets. If your children are too young to understand spoken instructions on “playing nice” then your best bet is to lead by example. ,Important Things to Teach Your Child ,Respect ,Teaching your child to respect all creatures is a gift for both child and your cat. ,You know when your cat is scared or overwhelmed. ,Let your child know your cat wishes to be left alone, not touched when sleeping, and to respect the kitty’s feelings. ,Play ,Modeling the behavior will show your child how to “play nice.” ,Have your child watch you play and speak gently to your cat. Then have them do it as you supervise. ,Safety ,Showing your child how to handle the family cat will keep them both safe. ,Explain that cats do not feel secure when “big people” suddenly pick them up. ,If age appropriate, show them the proper way to pick up and hold your cat with their arm under the cat’s bottom. Explain that this should only be done when you are there to supervise. ,Care ,Letting your child help care for your cat by giving her/him age appropriate tasks will allow the two to form a bond. ,Even a very young child can help with feeding when supervised. Make sure to let your child know what you are doing and why it is important."

      "description": "While you are caring for a pregnant cat, do not give her any vaccines, and consult with your vet for proper treatment of parasites like fleas and worms. Feed the mama-cat-to-be a high-quality food that is labeled for growth/kittens, approved by The Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO), and properly supplemented with taurine, Dr. Guess advises. Taurine deficiencies can cause fetal deformities or even death. It may be helpful to supplement with canned food to ensure the pregnant cat is getting enough calories, especially during the latter part of gestation. You need to create a “queening” box, where your cat will make her nest and give birth. Find a warm place with a lot of privacy to put the queening box. You can use a cardboard box, laundry basket or other roomy container, and line it with things like blankets, sheets, newspapers and puppy pads. “Use something you’re ready to throw away after you have kittens, because it’s going to be bloody and it’s going to be messy,” says Dr. Foote, owner of Okaw Veterinary Clinic in Tuscola, Illinois. Ideally, Dr. Guess advises, a queening box should have raised sides, a side entrance that is off the ground and a removable lid. But cats being cats, your queen might not cooperate with your choice of birthing quarters. “Of course, some will decide the box is not ideal and will think someplace like the middle of the owner’s bed is a good place to give birth,” Dr. Guess says."

      "description": "Safety Tips for Kids and Cats  According to The American Pet Products Association 62 percent of American households have either a dog, a cat, or both. Chances are, if you already have pets and kids, they’ve learned how to get along. But if you’re thinking of adopting a new cat, then it’s worth an overview of kid and cat safety tips. After all, cats have sharp claws and kids aren’t always gentle with cats. Yet, there’s an easy way around that, and it’s to teach your children how respect cats as living creatures and learn how to interact with them in a positive way. As you know, it’s not difficult to recognize kitty behavior and know when to give them some space. It's important to know the signs. The beauty is, your kids have lots of control over this since they can learn how to approach the cat and when to leave it alone. Children Have a Wonderful Opportunity When it Comes to Cats When children are gentle and kind, friendly cats will come to trust and appreciate them. But if the children are loud and unpredictable, then the cat is going to make itself scarce. The opportunity then is for the child to learn how to approach a cat in a friendly manner, which may mean not approaching the cat at all, but allowing the cat to come to them instead As Hillspet reminds us, “As adorable as she may be, she's a living companion who has just as many feelings as her human housemates. And although cats can become frightened of kids if they are too rough, playing gently on her terms will make her more likely to enjoy their company. It's up to the child to show the cat she can trust them not to cause any harm. Reading a Cat’s Body Language Learning to read an animal’s body language is a good life skill to have, and if you’ve spent any time with cats, you know they rarely lash out without warning. Children of all ages can learn to tell the difference between a friendly cat and one who’s sending “danger” signs.  Hissing, a swishing tail, and flattened ears are just some of the common signals that say, “Stay away!” As you may know, cats often telegraph their moods through their tails and ears. Petfinder.com shares these tips on cat ears. These are three ear positions to watch for that say, “Leave me alone!” “Ears turned back – Watch out for this kitty! He might feel irritated [o ] over stimulated, so it’s probably a good idea to leave him alone Ears turned sideways or back – This cat is feeling nervous or anxious about something. Use caution around a cat whose ears are in this position Ears back and flat against head – This is a sure sign a cat is scared and feeling defensive Ears flat against the head may also indicate an angry or aggressive cat. Either way, ears against the head means don’t mess with this guy! A happy and relaxed cat will have upright ears or they’ll be slightly turned forward. Likewise, the tail is a major giveaway. A swishing tail, or one that is hanging low between the legs indicates annoyance or anxiety respectively. Of course, the famed “Halloween-cat” stance - with the tail upright, fur standing on end, and an angry stare - definitely means leave the cat alone. When children learn to “read” these signals, they’ll know when to back off and leave the cat alone.",

      "description": "Cats are one of the most common pets people keep, yet only a handful of cat owners know how to treat their pets when they are under the weather. Seeing your beloved cat suffering is upsetting, so here are a few important things to keep in mind while caring for your sick cat so they may be back to normal in no time. It is best to take your pet to the vet as soon as possible, so that you can pin point exactly what is causing their ailment.

Feed your sick cat healthy food:Consuming nutritious food can speed up their recovery. Getting a sick cat to eat can be quite the challenge, but offering slightly-warmed canned food like tuna or chicken with their natural juices and oil may help. You may need to hand feed them at first if they are not eating on their own.
